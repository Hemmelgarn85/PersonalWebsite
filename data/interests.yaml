      Aside from developing, I equally enjoy spending time outdoors as well as indoors. When the weather is right, you
      can find me rock climbing, golfing, or riding my bike.

      When the weather is not quite as nice, I love reading, video games, or catching up on a new tv show or movie.
      My favorite genres of movies or books include sci-fi and fantasy. Sometimes, I just can't put down a good book.
